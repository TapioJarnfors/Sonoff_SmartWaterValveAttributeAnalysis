# Sonoff Smart Water Valve Attribute Analysis

This document provides a detailed analysis of the event timeline for the Sonoff Smart Water Valve, focusing on both quantitative and timed irrigation cycles. The analysis is based on packet captures, highlighting key events and their corresponding attributes. My watering system uses low flow volumes, which was the main reason to investigate and study how the valve operates in an "out of normal" range. The flow range of the SONOFF Smart Water Valve starts from 0.1 m³/h, while my system uses around 0.07 m³/h. The valve works with timed irrigation as needed, but its reporting differs compared to the "normal flow range."

Details are in the file Sonoff_SmartWaterValveAnalysis_0r0.md and any comments or suggestions are welcome.
